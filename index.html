                <p id="first_section_para1">The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) have warned us that millions of lives are at risk in four countries stretching from Asia, Africa to the Middle East. Millions of children, orphans and their communities have little or no access to food and nutrition. Famine is death by hunger, slow, brutal and painful and millions are dying this way. </p>

                <p>Education is the birthright of every child. There are many reasons why education is vital for children. It develops wisdom and intelligence which help in being self-dependent in life. It plays a vital role in the development of personality. It develops confidence also and helps us to become a responsible citizen of the nation.
